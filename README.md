gem5 model for the ARM Cortex-A8 processor

I am Andr√©s Gallego, and my research is about computer architecture. Memory hierarchy modelling using gem5, emulation of an in-order processor like Cortex-A8 and some tutorials about using simulators like qemu can be found on this repo. Hope you enjoy it!
