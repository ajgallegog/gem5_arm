gem5 model for the ARM Cortex-A8 processor

I am Andr√©s Gallego, and my research is about computer architecture. Memory hierarchy modelling using gem5, emulation of an in-order processor like Cortex-A8 and some tutorials about using simulators like qemu can be found on this repo. Hope you enjoy it! 

In order to run the simulator, you should follow the instructions in gem5.org to compile it, and then run m5.sh script to have a full-system simulation for ARM Cortex A8 implemented. It can run the same benchmarks as if you had them in real hardware, boot Ubuntu or any O.S for embedded systems and connect through a serial console to see the results.
